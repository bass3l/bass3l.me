<p>
  Hello there! I'm Bassel Shmali, a software engineer from Syria. <strike>I'm currently pursuing</strike> I have a Bachelor Degree in CS from Damascus University and currently working as a lead engineer at <a href='http://transtek.com'>Transtek Systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I love working on web technologies and implementing cool ideas, I spend my days as a lead software engineer at <a href='http://transtek.com'>Transtek Systems</a> which is a leading company in ERP systems in the Middle East. In addition I spend my free time doing some remote jobs or hacking around Javascript and all its flavours, I've been lately hacking around ASP.NET Core which sounds promising.
</p>
<p>
  If I'm not coding or reading something, I would be playing on my PS4.
</p>
<p>
  This is going to be my personnel blog, where I'd like to write about the stuff I'm interested in. Which most of the time are about software development and the ideas and history of it.
</p>
<p>
  Please feel free to contact me :D.
