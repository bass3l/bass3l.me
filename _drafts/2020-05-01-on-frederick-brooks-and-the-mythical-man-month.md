Frederick Brooks is a software engineer, a computer scientist and a winner of the Turing Award (1999), the highest honor of computer science, for his contributions to computer and operating systems. He is most known for his work on IBM's OS/360 (A failed project which its workforce was spanning between 5000 to 6000 people).

The first time I've heard of him is from my teacher in the forth year of my college at Damascus University on the first software engineering course that I had. At that time, we were discussing the software estimation practices and the **Mythical Man-Month** was mentioned.

The Mythical Man-Month, is a book about software engineering and project management written in 1975 by Brooks. The book focuses on the human elements of software engineering and has coined alot of practicies that are considered as laws on the software engineering field. Due to the current lockdown of COVID-19, I had the chance to re-read it and decided to write this blog post as a summary of what I've found interesting and relatable in his book, while adding my comments. Although it's a some-how an old book, most of the discussed points are relatable and true to this day.

## What Makes Programming Fun?

> "When I finished grad school in computer science I went to art school to study painting. A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting. They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge. 
Both of these images are wrong. Hacking and painting have a lot in common. In fact, of all the different types of people I've known, hackers and painters are among the most alike, they're both makers." <span style="display:block;text-align: right;">- Paul Graham, Hackers and Painters</span>

Watching complex puzzle-like interlocking objects and watching them working in cycles was like magic to me, and that's what I think made me invloved in this field in the first place, the joy of making things. Brooks discussed multiple reseaons that makes programming and software engineering a fun for many, and the joy of making things is one of them.

One of the remaining reasons is the pleasure of making useful stuff for what we call the end-users, deep down we want others to use our software and find it helpful. Addionally, is the never-stop-learning nature of software, where we're always trying to solve new problems, learning about them and about approaches to tacle them.

And finally, programmers are just like poets, their work is a work of fiction which you can't hold in your hands, they build castles in the air from air.
